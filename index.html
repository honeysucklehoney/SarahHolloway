      <h1>Sarah Lauren Holloway</h1>
      
      <p> I am a graduate from the Department of Furniture Design at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).
         My practice is an amalgamation of traditional craft techniques in conversation with the rapidly 
         developing field of tech design - from wifi routers to PC cases. I believe computation can be 
         reinterpreted as a craft discipline and integrated into the history of craft. 
         
         <br><br> For instance, the jacquard loom is often regarded as the precursor to modern computation, and the inventor of 
         copper-printed computer chips drew inspiration from historical printmaking techniques. Yet, 
         computation is frequently siloed, detaching its discourse and history from other fields with deeper
         traditions of human innovation. My work seeks to offer an alternative, holistic approach to tech
         criticism that is rooted in longer traditions of making and cultural production.
           <br><br>
         My studies in aesthetics are researched and presented under the moniker, Pretty Secrets, an ongoing 
        traveling exhibition series that presents the work of emerging design talent focused on how traditional
         craft techniques stretching millennia can be pulled at and pieced together to dialogue with the 
         conditions of the present. 
         <br><br>
         I produce some work for the joy of use. This can be purchased in 'Designed for Purchase' which appears in navagation bar only when there is one or more works for sale. 
         At this moment there is nothing avaibale for purchase. Please reach out if you have further questions.
